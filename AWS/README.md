- The most cost-efficient instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure - batch jobs, data analysis, image processing, any distributed workloads, workloads with a flexible start and end time
- not suitable for critical jobs or databases

**Dedicated Hosts** - 
- Physical servers dedicated just for your use
- You then have control over which instances are deployed on that host
- Available as on-demand or with a dedicated hosts reservation
- Useful if you have server-bound software licenses that use metrics like per-core, per-socket, per-VM
- Each dedicated host can run only on instance size and type
- Good for regulatory compliance or licensing requiremnets
- Predictable performance
- Complete isolation
- Most expensive option
- Billing is per host

**Dedicated Instances** - 
- Virtualized instances on hardware just for you
- Also uses physically dedicated EC2 servers
- Does not provide additional visibility and controls of dedicated host 
- Billing is per instance 
- May share hardware with other non-dedicated instances in the same account
- Available as on-demand, reserved instances, spot instances
- Cost additional $2 per hour per region

**Capacity Reservations** - 
- Reserve on-demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration 
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it 
- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discount
- Combine with regional reserved instances and saving plans to benefit from billing discount
- You are charged at on-demand rate whether you run instances or not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ

###**How to choose a purchasing option ???** - 

Let's understand these concepts of purchasing options by taking the example of booking a resort

- **On-demand** - coming and staying in a resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- **Reserved instances** - like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount
- **Spot instances** - the hotel allows people to bid for the empty room and the highest bidder keeps the rooms but can get kicked out anytime if anyone gives high price than them
- **Dedicated hosts** - we book an entire building of the resort 
- **Capacity reservations** - you book a room for a period with full price even if you don't stay


### **Overview**
Amazon EC2 offers several purchasing options to optimize costs:

1. **On-Demand Instances**: Pay for instances by the second.
2. **Savings Plans**: Commit to a consistent usage level for 1 or 3 years.
3. **Reserved Instances**: Commit to specific configurations for 1 or 3 years.
4. **Spot Instances**: Use spare EC2 capacity at reduced costs.
5. **Dedicated Hosts**: Full physical servers for your instances.
6. **Dedicated Instances**: Single-tenant instances.
7. **Capacity Reservations**: Reserve capacity in specific AZs.

# 📌 Introduction to NFS  

## 🔹 What is NFS?  
- **NFS = Network File System**  
- It is a way for computers to **share files over a network**.  
- Think of it like **Google Drive or OneDrive**, but for servers inside a network.  
- With NFS, you can create one storage location and let **multiple computers (clients)** connect and use it as if it were their own local disk.  

---

## 🔹 How does it work?  
- Two main parts:  
  1. **NFS Server** → The machine that has the actual storage and shares it.  
  2. **NFS Clients** → Other machines that connect to the server and access files.  

- Clients mount (attach) the shared folder and can **read/write files** just like a normal folder.  

---

## 🔹 Real-life Example  
- Imagine a company office:  
  - The **NFS Server** is like the office filing cabinet.  
  - Employees (clients) don’t keep their own copies, they just **open the same cabinet drawer** and work on the same files.  
  - If one person updates a document, everyone sees the update instantly.  

---

## 🔹 Key Features of NFS  
1. **Centralized Storage** – Files are stored in one place, not scattered across machines.  
2. **Shared Access** – Multiple servers can access the same data.  
3. **Scalability** – Add more clients without copying files everywhere.  
4. **Transparency** – To the client, it looks like a normal folder/directory.  
5. **Uses TCP/UDP Port 2049** – Default port for NFS communication.  

---

## 🔹 Why do we need NFS?  
- Without NFS: Every server would have its **own local files**, making it difficult to share or sync data.  
- With NFS: All servers point to the **same storage**, making collaboration and scaling easier.  

**Use Cases:**  
- Hosting a website on multiple servers → all servers can use **same images, code, or logs** from NFS.  
- In AWS → **EFS (Elastic File System)** is Amazon’s managed NFS service.  

---

## 🔹 Versions of NFS  
- **NFSv2** – Old version, basic sharing.  
- **NFSv3** – Supports large files, better performance.  
- **NFSv4** – Latest, more secure (supports encryption, ACLs).  
- AWS EFS uses **NFSv4.1** by default.  

---

# 📌 NFS in AWS Context  

### Is NFS Region-specific or AZ-specific?  

- **NFS (general protocol)** → Not tied to region/AZ, depends only on network reachability.  

- **Amazon EFS (managed NFS)**:  
  - **Region-specific** → An EFS file system exists only in one AWS region.  
  - **Multi-AZ** → Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones within that region.  
  - Instances in different AZs of the same region can mount the same EFS file system.  

---

## ✅ Quick Summary  
- **NFS protocol** → Not tied to region/AZ, just needs network connectivity.  
- **AWS EFS** →  
  - Region-specific.  
  - Multi-AZ within that region for high availability.  

👉 In AWS terms:  
**EFS is region-specific, but can be accessed from multiple AZs within that region.**

---

# 📌 Practical: Create and Mount Amazon EFS (NFS)

# Basics of Networking

Networking is the backbone of modern computing and communication systems. It involves connecting devices to share resources, data, and information efficiently. Key components and concepts of networking include:

## Key Networking Components:
1. **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):** A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It can be IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

2. **Subnet Mask:** Defines the network and host portions of an IP address. For example, in IPv4, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 allows 256 total addresses, of which one is for the network and one for broadcast.

3. **Gateway:** A node that routes traffic from one network to another, typically connecting a private network to the internet.

4. **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.

5. **MAC Address (Media Access Control):** A hardware address that identifies devices within a local network.

## Types of Networks:
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small networks, typically within a single location, such as a home or office.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Large networks spanning geographic locations, such as the internet.
- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):** Logical segmentation of a LAN for better management and security.

## Networking Protocols:
1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** Core protocol suite for communication over the internet.
2. **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for transferring hypertext data (webpages).
3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** For transferring files over a network.
4. **SSH (Secure Shell):** For secure remote administration.

# CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

## What is CIDR?
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for efficiently allocating IP addresses and routing data. It replaces the older class-based IP addressing system (Class A, B, and C).

## CIDR Notation:
CIDR uses a suffix to specify the number of significant bits in the subnet mask. The format is:

```
IP Address/Prefix Length
```
For example:
- `192.168.1.0/24` means the first 24 bits are for the network, and the remaining 8 bits are for hosts.

## CIDR Example:
### Given `192.168.1.0/24`:
- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0
- **Total IPs:** 256 (2^8 for the last octet)
- **Usable IPs:** 254 (Subtract 1 for the network and 1 for broadcast address)
- **Range:** 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254

## Benefits of CIDR:
1. **Efficient IP Address Allocation:** Prevents waste by allowing subnets of variable sizes.
2. **Improved Routing Efficiency:** Reduces the size of routing tables by grouping multiple networks under a single prefix.
3. **Scalability:** Supports hierarchical network design for better scalability.

## Practical Steps:

### Step 1: Understand Your Network Requirements
- Determine the number of hosts and subnets needed.
- Choose an IP range and prefix length that accommodates your needs.

### Step 2: Subnetting
- Use tools like subnet calculators or calculate manually.
- Example: Subnet `192.168.1.0/24` into smaller subnets like `192.168.1.0/26` and `192.168.1.64/26`.

### Step 3: Configure Networking Devices
- Assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to devices.
- Update DNS records as needed.

### Step 4: Verify Network Configuration
- Use commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nslookup` to test connectivity and resolve issues.

# Introduction to VPC

## What is a VPC?
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selecting your own IP address range, creating subnets, and configuring route tables and gateways.

### Key Features of a VPC:
- **Logical Isolation:** Operates within a region, providing control over network setup.
- **Subnets:** Divide your VPC into smaller segments based on your requirements.
- **Security:** Use security groups and network ACLs for fine-grained control.
- **Internet Gateway:** Attach to a VPC for internet access.
- **Private Connectivity:** Use VPN or Direct Connect to connect on-premises environments.
- **Elastic IPs:** Assign static IP addresses to resources in your VPC.

### VPC Types:
1. **Default VPC:** Automatically created by AWS in each region. It includes a public subnet in each Availability Zone, enabling immediate access to AWS services.
2. **Custom VPC:** Created manually to meet specific networking requirements, offering full control over the network configuration.

### Reserved IPs in AWS:
Within each subnet's CIDR block, AWS reserves the following IP addresses:
- **.0:** Network address.
- **.1:** Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
- **.2:** Reserved for mapping Amazon-provided DNS.
- **.3:** Reserved for future use.
- **Last IP:** Reserved for the network broadcast address. 

For example, in a `/24` subnet (`192.168.1.0/24`):
- Reserved IPs: `192.168.1.0`, `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.1.2`, `192.168.1.3`, and `192.168.1.255`.

# CIDR Calculation for Subnets

## What is CIDR?
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing. Instead of using the traditional class-based system, CIDR allows IP ranges to be split into subnets with flexible sizes.

### CIDR Notation:
A CIDR block is expressed as `IP address/prefix length`. For example, `192.168.0.0/24`:
- **192.168.0.0**: Network portion.
- **/24**: Indicates that the first 24 bits represent the network, leaving 8 bits for host addresses.

### Subnetting Calculation:
1. **Determine the Number of Hosts:**
   - Formula: `2^(32 - prefix length) - 2`
   - Example: `/24` = `2^(32 - 24) - 2 = 254 usable hosts`

2. **Divide a Larger Block:**
   - Example: To split `10.0.0.0/16` into four subnets, increase the prefix length to `/18`. Resulting subnets:
     - `10.0.0.0/18`
     - `10.0.64.0/18`
     - `10.0.128.0/18`
     - `10.0.192.0/18`

### Practical Example:
- **Base CIDR:** `10.0.0.0/16`
- **Required Subnets:** 4
- **Step:** Adjust prefix length to `/18` to accommodate each subnet.

# Networking, Elastic IPs, Placement Groups, and Security

## NIC (Network Interface Controller) and Elastic IP

### NIC (Network Interface Controller)
A Network Interface Controller (NIC) in AWS is also referred to as an Elastic Network Interface (ENI). It is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). ENIs provide network connectivity for instances and include attributes such as a private IPv4 address, an IPv6 address (optional), security groups, a MAC address, and a source/destination check flag.

#### Key Features of NIC:
- **Primary Network Interface**: Automatically created with every instance and cannot be detached.
- **Secondary Network Interfaces**: Can be attached or detached from instances, offering flexibility in multi-network configurations.
- **Custom Configuration**: Security groups, IP addresses, and MAC addresses can be customized.

#### Practical Steps to Manage ENIs:
1. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select **Network Interfaces** from the left-hand menu.
3. Create a new ENI by providing the VPC, Subnet, and security group details.
4. Attach the ENI to an instance from the **Actions** menu.

### Elastic IP
An Elastic IP (EIP) is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. You can associate an EIP with your instance or ENI to allow external internet access.

#### Key Features of Elastic IP:
- **Static**: Remains unchanged unless manually released.
- **Reassignable**: Can be reassigned between instances in your account.
- **One Free IP**: AWS provides one Elastic IP per account without cost if it is associated with a running instance.

#### Practical Steps to Assign an Elastic IP:
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select **Elastic IPs** from the left-hand menu.
3. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address**.
4. Associate the EIP with an instance or network interface.

   - Instances are placed close together within a single Availability Zone.
   - High throughput and low latency.
   - Ideal for HPC (High-Performance Computing) and big data workloads.

2. **Spread Placement Group**:
   - Instances are placed across different hardware within an Availability Zone.
   - Increases fault tolerance.
   - Ideal for small critical workloads.

3. **Partition Placement Group**:
   - Instances are divided into logical partitions.
   - Each partition is isolated from others.
   - Used for large distributed and replicated workloads such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra.

#### Practical Steps to Create a Placement Group:
1. Open the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select **Placement Groups** from the left-hand menu.
3. Click **Create Placement Group** and provide a name.
4. Choose the type of placement group and add the instances during or after creation.

## NACL (Network Access Control List) vs Security Group

### NACL (Network Access Control List):
- Acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
- Operates at the subnet level.
- **Stateless**: Rules need to be explicitly defined for both inbound and outbound traffic.
- Supports rules by rule number with allow and deny actions.

### Security Group:
- Acts as a firewall for controlling traffic to and from an instance.
- Operates at the instance level.
- **Stateful**: Automatically allows responses to inbound traffic.
- Only supports allow rules.

### Key Differences:
| Feature                | NACL                         | Security Group             |
|------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scope                  | Subnet-level                 | Instance-level             |
| State                  | Stateless                    | Stateful                   |
| Rule Actions           | Allow and Deny               | Allow only                 |
| Default Behavior       | Allows all traffic by default| Denies all traffic by default|

#### Practical Steps to Manage NACL:
1. Navigate to the **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select **Network ACLs** from the left-hand menu.
3. Create a new NACL and associate it with subnets.
4. Add inbound and outbound rules as required.

#### Practical Steps to Manage Security Groups:
1. Open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Select **Security Groups** from the left-hand menu.
3. Create a new security group by specifying rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
4. Attach the security group to instances during or after launch.
